__PROJECT DESCRIPTION__

Application name: `Rougelike the game`

Our application will be a roguelike-game. A main hero is `a Ball` who explores the `Labyrinth` and challenges different obstacles like furiuos monsters and tricky traps. `Labyrinth` consists of different stages, but our hero has ultimate goal
to achieve by passing all `Labyrinth`. Game has different endings, depending on player passing.

Our game will be interesting for person of any age, because it will be dinamic and brainstorming at the same time,
and in that case it will have great succes on Play Market.
